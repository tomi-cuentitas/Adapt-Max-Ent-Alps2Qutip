    Computes the Gram matrix of a given operator basis using a scalar product.

    The Gram matrix is symmetric and defined as:
        Gij = sp(op1, op2)
    where `sp` is the scalar product function and `op1, op2` are operators from
    the basis.

    Parameters:
        basis: A list of basis operators.
        sp: A callable that defines a scalar product function between two
        operators.

    Returns:
        A symmetric NumPy array representing the Gram matrix, with entries
        rounded to 14 decimal places.
